== Introduction

The *Vaadin Flow* module provides integration between the Holon Platform architecture and the link:https://vaadin.com/flow[Vaadin Flow^] web applications platform. 

The module main features are:

* A complete set of UI components _fluent_ builders, to make the UI development fast and easy.
* A full integration with the Holon Platform link:holon-core.html#Property[Property model^] and link:holon-core.html#Datastore[Datastore API^] for data bound UI components.
* A complete support for UI components and messages localization, using the Holon Platform link:holon-core.html#i18n[internationalization^] support.
* A convenient _navigation_ API to manage the UI _views_, with typed parameters support and components lifecycle management.
* Integration with the Holon Platform link:holon-core.html#Auth[authentication and authentication^] architecture.
* A complete integration with *Spring* and *Spring Boot*, with application auto-configuration facilities.

=== Sources and contributions

The Holon Platform *Vaadin* module source code is available from the GitHub repository link:https://github.com/holon-platform/holon-vaadin-flow[https://github.com/holon-platform/holon-vaadin-flow^].

See the repository `README` file for information about:

* The source code structure.
* How to build the module artifacts from sources.
* Where to find the code examples.
* How to contribute to the module development.

== Obtaining the artifacts

The Holon Platform uses https://maven.apache.org[Maven^] for projects build and configuration. All the platform artifacts are published in the *Maven Central Repository*, so there is no need to explicitly declare additional repositories in your project `pom` file.

At the top of each _section_ of this documentation you will find the Maven _coordinates_ (group id, artifact id and version) to obtain the artifact(s) as a dependency for your project.

A *BOM (Bill Of Materials)* `pom` is provided to import the available dependencies for a specific version in your projects. The Maven coordinates for the core BOM are the following:

_Maven coordinates_:
[source, xml, subs="attributes+"]
----
<groupId>com.holon-platform.vaadin</groupId>
<artifactId>holon-vaadin-flow-bom</artifactId>
<version>{revnumber}</version>
----

The BOM can be imported in a Maven project in the following way:

[source, xml, subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes+"]
----
<dependencyManagement>
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.holon-platform.vaadin</groupId>
			<artifactId>holon-vaadin-flow-bom</artifactId>
			<version>{revnumber}</version>
			*<type>pom</type>*
			*<scope>import</scope>*
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

=== Using the Platform BOM

The Holon Platform provides an *overall Maven BOM (Bill of Materials)* to easily obtain all the available platform artifacts.

See link:index.html#obtain-the-platform-artifacts[Obtain the platform artifacts] for details.

// Inclusions

include::_core.adoc[]

include::_navigator.adoc[]

include::_spring.adoc[]

== Loggers

By default, the Holon platform uses the https://www.slf4j.org[SLF4J^] API for logging. The use of SLF4J is optional: it is enabled when the presence of SLF4J is detected in the classpath. Otherwise, logging will fall back to JUL (`java.util.logging`).

The logger name for the *Vaadin* module is `com.holonplatform.vaadin`.

== System requirements

=== Java

The Holon Platform Vaadin module requires https://www.java.com[Java^] *8* or higher.

=== Vaadin

The Holon Platform Vaadin module requires the https://vaadin.com/flow[Vaadin Flow^] platform version *12* or higher.
